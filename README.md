# SQuAD2.0


Check on the following while training:
- --batch_size : default 64 (try 4)
- --num_workers : default 4 (try 2 or 1)
- --num_epochs : default 30 (try -1 to train forever)
- --eval_steps : default 50k (try anything lower, decide according to how much time it takes for the eval) 

handle_json.py
- contains the split code
- open and set the splits sizes

<br>

To do on colab:
```bash
# open handle_json.py and change the splits
python3 handle_json.py # to make the splits, skip to use entire train.json


# Skip --train_url if training over entire train.json
python3 setup.py --train_url train-v2.0_1.json # to use the first split. To use the second split use 'train-v2.0_2.json'


python3 train.py -n baseline_train --num_workers 4 --num_epochs 5 --eval_steps 5000 --batch_size 4 # set the args accordingly
```
-----------------------------
## Setup

1. Make sure you have [Miniconda](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation) installed
    1. Conda is a package manager that sandboxes your projectâ€™s dependencies in a virtual environment
    2. Miniconda contains Conda and its dependencies with no extra packages by default (as opposed to Anaconda, which installs some extra packages)

2. cd into src, run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
    1. This creates a Conda environment called `squad`

3. Run `conda activate squad`
    1. This activates the `squad` environment
    2. Do this each time you want to write/test your code
  
4. Run `python setup.py`
    1. This downloads SQuAD 2.0 training and dev sets, as well as the GloVe 300-dimensional word vectors (840B)
    2. This also pre-processes the dataset for efficient data loading
    3. For a MacBook Pro on the Stanford network, `setup.py` takes around 30 minutes total  

5. Browse the code in `train.py`
    1. The `train.py` script is the entry point for training a model. It reads command-line arguments, loads the SQuAD dataset, and trains a model.
    2. You may find it helpful to browse the arguments provided by the starter code. Either look directly at the `parser.add_argument` lines in the source code, or run `python train.py -h`.

To train and open Tensorboard:

```bash
python3 trian.py -n baseline_train

tensorboard --logdir save --port 5678 # Start TensorBoard

python3 test.py -n test --load_path ./save/train/18-05-01/step_50000.pth.tar  #  For submission to leaderboard

```

## Evaluating Model:
To run the evaluation:
```bash
python3 evaluate-v2.0.py <path_to_dev-v2.0> <path_to_predictions>
```

Sample input:
```bash
python3 evaluate-v2.0.py data/dev-v2.0.json dev-evaluate-v2.0-in1.txt
```

Sample output:
```
